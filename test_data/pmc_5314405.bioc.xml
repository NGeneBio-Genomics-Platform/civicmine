EGFR mutation status were collected from 1560 patients with NSCLC and BM. 356 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation and BM were identified. Among them, 91 patients received EGFR-TKIs alone and 105 patients received EGFR-TKIs plus bisphosphonates as first-line therapy. Comparing to TKIs alone, EGFR-TKIs plus bisphosphonates had a statistically significant longer progression-free survival (PFS: 11.6 vs. 9.3 months; HR = 0.68, P = 0.009), while a similar overall survival (OS: 20.5 vs. 19.5 months; HR = 0.95, P = 0.743) in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and BM. The incidence of skeletal-related events in combined group was numerically lower than that in EGFR-TKIs alone group (29.7% vs. 39.4%, P = 0.147). In multivariate analysis, EGFR mutation was found to be a significant independent prognostic factor for OS in NSCLC patients with BM (HR = 0.710, P = 0.021). In conclusion, EGFR mutation was the significant independent prognostic factor for OS and the addition of bisphosphonates to EGFR-TKIs could enhance the antitumor effect of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and BM.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">None</infon><offset>1441</offset><text>Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers as well as the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide . The averaged 5-year survival rate of lung cancer is 17.4%, which drastically reduced to 4.2% in distant or metastasized lung cancer . Bone metastasis (BM) represents one of the most deleteriously metastatic lung cancer and associates with dismal prognosis. About 30–40% patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop BM with a median survival of 6 months . The skeletal-related events (SREs) caused by BM could further deteriorate the prognosis of patients with BM .</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">None</infon><offset>2028</offset><text>Currently, the therapeutic strategies to manage BM are still limited. Systemic therapies that block osteoclast activity including bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, ibandronic acid or disodium pamidronate etc.) and Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B Ligand (RANKL) inhibitors (denosumab) can reduce the incidence of SREs . In a phase III randomized trial, denosumab could slightly delay the appearance of SREs in NSCLC as compared to bisphosphonates . Bisphosphonates are stable analogues of inorganic pyrophosphate that induce osteoclast apoptosis, inhibit bone resorption, osteoclast formation and recruitment. They are efficient for the prevention of skeletal complications and generally recommended in patients with BM. In the preclinical studies, bisphosphonates exerted anti-tumor effects in NSCLC, including the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and micrometastasis . Furthermore, preclinical data also showed that bisphosphonates could enhance the inhibitory effects of EGFR-TKIs on NSCLC with EGFR mutation both in vitro  and in vivo . In clinical setting, a retrospective study with a small cohort of 62 cases found that bisphosphonates plus EGFR-TKIs had statistically significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and OS than EGFR-TKIs alone (median PFS: 15.0 vs 7.3 months, P = 0.03; OS: 25.2 vs 10.4 months, P = 0.0015) . However, this study could just present a clue of bisphosphonates on EGFR TKI due to the limited cases and larger cohorts study is needed to further validate the role of bisphosphonates in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC and BM.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">None</infon><offset>3637</offset><text>Thus, we analyzed this large cohort of 1560 patients with BM and advanced NSCLC to investigate whether bisphosphonates affect the outcome of first-line EGFR-TKIs therapy in Chinese NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation and BM.

We found that EGFR mutation was a significant independent prognostic factor for OS in BM patients with NSCLC. More importantly, the addition of bisphosphonates to EGFR-TKIs had longer PFS, while similar OS than TKIs alone in BM patients with EGFR mutations. However, bisphosphonates showed no additional PFS or OS benefit when combined with chemotherapy as the first line setting in patients with NSCLC and BM.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>9604</offset><text>Bisphosphonates are the frequently used for preventing SRE in NSCLC patients with BM . Several preclinical studies found that bisphosphonates could enhance the effects of EGFR-TKIs on EGFR mutant NSCLC both in vitro  and in vivo . In clinical setting, a small cohort study with limited cases also showed that EGFR-TKIs plus bisphosphonates could significantly prolong PFS and OS in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC and BM than those received EGFR-TKIs alone as the first-line therapy (PFS: 15.0 vs 7.3 months, P = 0.03; OS: 25.2 vs 10.4 months, P = 0.0015) . In line with these studies, the present study also found that EGFR-TKIs plus bisphosphonates could prolong PFS than EGFR-TKIs alone (mPFS: 11.6 vs 9.2 months, P = 0.006). As we know, bisphosphonates can inhibit ERK1/2, AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, which was also the direct downstream pathway of EGFR. Thus, bisphosphonates could have a synergetic mechanism with EGFR-TKIs . The other possible explanation might be that the incidence rate of SREs in the TKI + BP group was numerically lower than it in the TKI group, which will contribute to a superior PFS in TKI + BP group since SREs are associated with poorer prognosis in patients with NSCLC and BM. However, OS was similar between two groups. In the past few years, dramatic improvement has been achieved for patients who get acquired resistance of EGFR-TKI due to the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies such as local therapies, anti-angiogenesis and third-generation EGFR-TKI. The patients enrolled into this study were chronological later than the patients in the previous study . Thus, the treatment beyond the disease progression of EGFR-TKI might contribute the discrepancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>11358</offset><text>Systemic chemotherapy is still the main therapeutic choice for advanced NSCLC without driver mutations. Several preclinical studies indicated that bisphosphonates could induce tumor cells apoptosis, inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis, affect immune microenvironment and therefore have antitumor effects in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC . While in clinical setting, a recent randomized phase II study failed to show the ability of zoledronic acid to augment the cytotoxic effects of the combination of docetaxel/carboplatin and to delay disease progression in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC . Another phase II trial also demonstrated that the combination of bisphosphonates and docetaxel had a similar survival when compared with docetaxel alone in advanced NSCLC patients with BM . Consistent with these results, our study demonstrated that chemotherapy plus bisphosphonates had a similar PFS and OS than chemotherapy alone, which suggest that bisphosphonates might not have a synthetic antitumor effect when combining with chemotherapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>12427</offset><text>Comprehensive understanding the process of BM formation could help to develop potential novel therapeutic compounds for BM. Bone metastasis is a continuous and complicated process and several features of the bone marrow microenvironment involve, including interaction with osteoclasts and osteoblasts promoting bone degradation releasing extracellular matrix (ECM) bound growth factors, which could also promote the development of lung cancer micrometastases . As a sequence, bone destruction and metastatic outgrowth, in another word “vicious cycle”, will continuously happen. One of the key factor to this vicious cycle is the RANKL . Recently, a phase III trial demonstrated that denosumab (RANKL antibody) could prolong OS versus zoledronic acid in patients with NSCLC and BM . RANKL’s major downstream target of is nuclear factor-kappa B, which is the downstream signaling pathway of EGFR . Herein, it is worthwhile to explore whether EGFR-TKIs combined with RANKL target agents could also have a synergistic effect in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC and BM. In addition, it was found that cellular and innate immunity in tumor microenvironment (TME) play pivotal roles in the modulation of BM . For example, infiltration of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) could further stimulate tumor-induced osteolysis . The role of other components in TME such as CD8 + T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), programmed death 1 (PD-1), PD-L1 and etc. need to be further investigated to help guiding the application of immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC and BM.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>13987</offset><text>Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, despite the fact that the initial population was large, the number of patients who entered the final analysis was relatively small. Therefore, the findings in this study need to be further validated in prospective trials with large scale. Secondly, this study is a retrospective study, which will inevitably have selection bias. Due to the side effects of bisphosphonates, it was not recommended to some patients with renal dysfunction or dental diseases. Thirdly, all of patients in this study received the third-generation bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid and ibandronic acid). Therefore, whether other bisphosphonates could improve patient’s survival combined with EGFR-TKIs needs further investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>14765</offset><text>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that EGFR mutation was a significant independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with advanced NSCLC and BM.

Then, patients received EGFR mutation test were chosen for the subsequent analysis. The major clinicopathological characteristics including demographic information, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), smoking history, lung cancer histology (WHO classification , number of BM, sites of extra-bone metastasis, EGFR mutation status, time of BM diagnosis, and SREs were all collected. A never smoker was defined as a person who had smoked less than 100 cigarettes during his lifetime. Smoking status, ECOG PS and age were documented at the time of diagnosis. Thoracic Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine established requirements for clinical information on patient follow-up under treatment, including response to treatment and survival. EGFR common mutations were defined as mutations including exon 19 deletion (19DEL) and Leu858Arg point mutation in exon 21 (L858R). EGFR rare mutations were those mutations other than 19DEL and L858R. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital and Henan Cancer Hospital.
